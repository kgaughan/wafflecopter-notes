# Wafflecopter Notes

Wafflecopter came out of a need to build my own notetaking application. Those that I'd used in the past had broken for various reasons on my work laptop so out of frustration, I decided to write my own.

My ultimate aim is to have it support at least a decent subset of the functionality of [Bear Notes](https://bear.app/), which is what I'd be using at work for my notetaking if I had an option. If you use a Mac and need a notes application, that's the one I recommend to you. [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) was my fallback, but that has also stopped working properly on my work laptop. That's a fine alternative.

I aim to keep Wafflecopter relatively lightweight. Ideally, it should be able to run on a small device with very little overhead. This was a particular downside of using Joplin as Electron apps tend to be quite heavyweight.

# Development

As much as anything else, Wafflecopter is an opportunity to refamiliarise myself with C++. At the time of writing, I'd about a decade since I wrote a substantial amount of it, so my familiarity with it has atrophied over time.

In the interests of portability, the project uses [wxWidgets](https://wxwidgets.org/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/). The former I've used before, but the latter I've only used as part of other projects. In addition, the project uses [astyle](https://astyle.sourceforge.net/) to keep the codebase consistent. The aim is to have the project run on both Linux and MacOS. The ability for it to run on Windows would be a bonus, but isn't a project aim.
